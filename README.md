This simple personal site has been enhanced with interactive and accessibility features:

- Theme toggle (light/dark) with preference persistence.
- Lightweight animated canvas background on the hero section.
- Project filters to quickly find AWS/GCP/DevOps projects.
- Improved keyboard accessibility and shortcuts: `t` toggles theme, `c` focuses contact name, `p` toggles particles (pause/resume).
- ARIA attributes and better focus outlines for keyboard users.

Files
- `index.html` — main page with hero, projects, contact.
- `style.css` — updated styling, dark theme variables, focus styles.
- `script.js` — typing effect, theme persistence, particles, filters, shortcuts.
- `resume.pdf` — resume (if present).

Open the site locally (e.g., using a static file server) to see the interactive features.
